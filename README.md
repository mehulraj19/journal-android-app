## Motivation
I have always saw different videos in youtube where in people tell their experiences in writing journals and how this helps them to get motivated and I, myself have started few 
weeks back when I got Covid and trust me, it helps a lot.
<br/>
Hence, I have developed this app where I can keep record of everything and it always be accessible by me and me only.
